// Transport-agnostic surface for exposing an IAIService. Implementations
// include in-process (direct call), HTTP loopback, and named pipes / socket
// IPC variants. Each endpoint owns whatever listener it needs and is
// responsible for marshalling cancellation through to the underlying service.
